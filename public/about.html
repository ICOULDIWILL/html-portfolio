<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The journey for me started in Brooklyn, NY, where I was born April 12th, 1990. I was blessed & fortunate to have the Mother that I do. Always believing in me & never letting me out of her sight. Here I am today, 33 years old, filling in my About Me section for everyone to read! So sit back and please enjoy yourself!</p>

<p>If there's one thing you should know about me, it is the fact that I love to sing! Singing is my very own form of therapy. Spending time with my family & friends while making memories gets no better for me. I have a younger brother named Brandon who I hope thinks this is cool and would like to do one of his own! I tend to try to look at every situation in my life as "the glass half full" rather than "half empty". I've also been living in Florida for about 2 years now on my own.</p>

<p>I consider myself a very humble person who tends to enjoy a quiet and simple life. Although I was born & raised in a city known to "never sleep", I could totally see myself living in an open field setting. Handball is the only sport that calls me (physically), while others call me via television to watch lol. I'm a father to a special 10-year-old boy named Aidan who gives me the motivation to leave impactful imprints every day that passes.</p>
